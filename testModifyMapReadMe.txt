Run test3.m to see function modifyMap in action. 
Plots out original map in Red and modified map in Green. 
Can't get it quite right, works for map 1
But falls down in map 2 and map 3 where the corners aren't 90deg. 
If some one else can have a look that would be fab, kind of sick at looking at it until next week at least 
And would like to code up the A* algorithm (I think it may take a while)

I am convinced there must be an easier way to do it, just been looking at it too long and can't see it
